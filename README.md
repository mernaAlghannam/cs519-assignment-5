Hereâ€™s what I did: <br>
- Add CI/CD to your assignment 4 codebase <br>
- Create a data entry Frontend so that product documents can be uploaded <br>
- Add Authentication to the Reporting and DataEntry Servers and backend servers <br>
- Create a queue that will indicate that a new job exists <br>
- Containerize an azure function API that inserts into the queue, reads from the queue, calls the Image => Text API and inserts the contents into the DB <br><br><br>
